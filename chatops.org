** What is ChatOps?
Different modes of communication for different purposes; face-to-face; voice (telephone, voice chat); IM (person-to-person) e.g. sametime/lync/skype for business/SMS/iMessage; video chat, e.g. facetime, google hangouts;
In this spectrum of communication modes, ChatOps takes IM to a new level by providing:
1. Rooms/Channels for groups of people to message each other
2. ChatOps is primarily a team-based solution, not an enterprise-wide solution
3. Chat messages are encryped end-to-end and chat logs are stored encryped
2. a persistent space where if you were OOO for a day or 5, you can easily catch-up with what went on while you were out
3. Mention someone's name and they are notified
4. one-on-one chats are always available (sometimes called private chats)
5. channels are a semi-permanent space where groups of people can chat on specific topics, e.g. Deployments
6. screen sharing that works
7. image and file sharing
8. integration with LDAP
9. ChatOps provides a common collaboration tool -- between teams with remote workers and with remote clients
10. video conferencing
