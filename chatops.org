** What is chatops?
Different modes of communication for different purposes; face-to-face; voice (telephone, voice chat); IM (person-to-person) e.g. sametime/lync/skype for business/SMS/iMessage; video chat, e.g. facetime, google hangouts;
In this spectrum of communication modes, chatops takes IM to a new level by providing:
1. Rooms/Channels for groups of people to message each other
2. ChatOps is primarily a team-based solution, not an enterprise-wide solution
3. Chat messages are encryped end-to-end and chat logs are stored encryped
2. a persistent space where if you were OOO for a day or 5, you can easily catch-up with what went on while you were out
3. Mention someone's name and they are notified
4. one-on-one chats are always available (sometimes called private chats)
5. channels are a semi-permanent space where groups of people can chat on specific topics, e.g. Deployments
6. screen sharing that works
7. image and file sharing
8. integration with LDAP
9. integrations and enhancements: also see plugins
10. video conferencing
