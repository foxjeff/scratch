### Starting a new repo from the command line:

1. FIRST - Create a new repo on github
>To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub. 
2. cd to directory with new-to-be repo
3. git init
4. create .gitignore
5. git add .
6. git commit -m "first commit"
7. get https url from new empty repo on github (on mac's https saves git credentials on keychain)
8. git remote add origin https-url
9. git remote -v to verify
10. git push origin master
11. say hello to uncle bob
12. don't forget to add a readme.md
